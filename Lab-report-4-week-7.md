# Part 2
Vscode Time after editing and copying over file: 38 seconds

vim Time with edits: 24 seconds

The only dificulty that was expericenced was when I was using Vscode when I was trying to find all the ```start``` cases manually.

***Question 1***

I think I prefer to use Vscode to work on programs remotley, the reasoning behind this is that I have been using Vscode for the last 2 years for most of my CSE classes so I am very confident navigating it. I think over time if I learn the ins and outs of vim and get more familarized with it I would eventually make the switch to vim from Vscode because its quicker and more efficent.

***Question 2***

I don't think any factor would make me switch from Vscode to vim currently because I am already familar with it and I feel like it is more "user friendly". Going into the future though I think when I am working with larger projects and many more files I think I will be forced to practice vim and use it in my day to day life because it is so much quicker and efficent than Vscode.
